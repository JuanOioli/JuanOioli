Professional with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Systems Analysis and Development and a Postgraduate degree in IT Management, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Over 6 years of experience in system development.

Focused on systems development and SRE, working on critical projects, delivery automation (CI/CD), and infrastructure as code. Experienced with AWS, GCP, and Azure, Kubernetes (AKS/EKS), observability, and project/metrics management. On a daily basis, I combine engineering best practices (code, security, and quality) with organization and metrics to bring predictability to delivery and improve operations. I also engage in mentoring, training, and sharing technical knowledge across teams.
